    <p><b>what is spirituality? why is it important?</b></p>
    <p><b>Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is something greater than myself, something more to being human than sensory experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in nature.</b></p>

<h3>How is spirituality linked with mental health?</h3>
  <div class="b">
    <p>Spirituality can help address issues such as poor self-esteem, low confidence, lack of self-control, and fear of daily tasks and challenges. For this reason, it can be a helpful extension to mental health treatment plans. It can also simply be a way of keeping mental health strong.</p>

  <li>taking steps toward fulfillment</li></ol>
<p style="width:50%">You don’t need to begin with a complete picture — after all, your journey is all about discovering what the full picture is.

    <li>Where do I see myself in 5 years? 10?</li>
    <li>What do I regret?</li>
   <li>What makes me proud of myself?</li></ol>
